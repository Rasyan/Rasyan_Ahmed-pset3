This is my submission for the third assignment of native app studio.

The assignment was to make an app that can search the internet for movies from imdb and can add them to their favorites that are displayed as a recyclerlist.

this app has to activitys:

The list view that shows both your faforites and the search result in a recylcerview depending on the data given to it from the intent.
it has a button that produces a pop up where the user can input its search term, afterwards it reloads the page to show these search result.
in both cases the individual items in the recyclerview can be pressed to go to the info screen.

The info screen activity shows more detailed information about the movie.
it has a button that either deletes the movie from your faforites if it is already in it or adds it to it if its not.
